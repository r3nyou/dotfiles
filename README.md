# dotfiles
Configuration files, and IDE setting I used.

## Jetbrains
### PhpStorm
- use [setting repository](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/settings-tools-settings-repository.html) to share IDE settings, here is my [repository](https://github.com/r3nyou/phpstorm-setting)
- use `:actionlist` to show all action can be set

## Visual Studio Code Setup
- settings.json - modifies the default settings offered by VS Code or its extensions
- keybindings.json - alter the default keybindings
